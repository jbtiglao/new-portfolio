# 08 Project 1: Professional Materials

The past several weeks have seen our class work on and deploy our first project and other API-related assignments. Now that we have a project to share and have had experience working with APIs, our next task is to update our developer portfolio page and other professional materials, toward being employer-competitive.

## Description

This README pertains to (1) the updated developer portfolio and (2) other professional materials consisting of the following: updated resume, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub profile.

### The Updated Portfolio
In terms of functionalities, this updated portfolio remains true to the first portofolio the developer was tasked to create at the beginning of the course. You can see the [deployed first portfolio here](https://jbtiglao.github.io/portfolio/) and its [GitHub repository and documentation here](https://github.com/jbtiglao/portfolio) for reference.

Meanwhile, the updated portfolio is deployed here: https://jbtiglao.github.io/new-portfolio/ while its repository is found here: https://github.com/jbtiglao/new-portfolio. It has the following interface:

It also has the following additional functionalities and features:

1. A display of Project 1 and two examples of the student's homework, which indicates their respective project title, link to the deployed version, link to the GitHub repository, and screenshot of the deployed application.

The live site and GitHub repositories for the project and the assignments are accessed by clicking the respective badges below each image.

2. A display of the developer's (student) contact information, including the student's developer email and Google Voice number. These are located on the application's sidebar.

3. Links to the developer's LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. The links are accessed by clicking the respective icons for LinkedIn and GitHub on the sidebar.

4. A link to a downloadable PDF of the developer's resume on Google Drive. This is found on the sidebar.

#### The Design

1. A polished, mobile-responsive user interface. The developer strived to create a more polished design than the portfolio she initially submitted. The developer has also used Bulma, having found that the framework makes it easier to manipulate the elements on a page, leading to a more responsive user interface and design, since Bulma is based on flexbox and primarily used for developing mobile-first applications.

2. A color palette that doesn't look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

3. A font size large enough to read and colors that don't cause eye strain.


#### Responsiveness

The updated resume has the following interface when viewed using different screens/devices:

![responsiveness](/assets/images/pic8_responsiveness.png)

The application is responsive when being zoomed in or out, or swiped up or down using the forefinger and thumb as is typically done with iPhone screens and tablets. It is also responsive when the device or screen is tilted or turned on its side.

1. iPhone 13

*	README files for every pinned project. Each README file contains the following: title of app, live link to deployed app, list of technologies used, 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is, 2-3 Screenshots of the app, MIT license, the contact information of the developer and/or any collaborators, and commit history.

2. Updated Resume that is:
*	Clear and concise, with a heading with the developer's name, Google Voice phone number, professional email address, and links to LinkedIn, portfolio, and GitHub. 

*	With a technical skills section containing all programming languages and technologies used.

*	Three of the developer's projects/homework assignments with brief description, languages used, and URL.


3. Updated LinkedIn profile with a bio statement, a professional photo, and links to the developer's Github and portfolio.
